# whiteboard-java-kotlin

Common whiteboard problems asked during coding interviews,
solved in Java and Kotlin.

The problems are grouped by category into modules,
e.g.  'arrays', 'strings', 'trees', etc. Each problem
is implemented as a pair of files, consisting of the
solution itself (in the 'main' subfolder), as well as
a unit test (in the 'test' subfolder).

The project was developed using the IntelliJ IDE,
running on Mac OS X. If you import the project into
another IDE, you may have to make minor changes.

Enjoy!
