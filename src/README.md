# whiteboard-cpp

Common whiteboard problems asked during coding interviews,
solved in Java.

The problems are grouped by category into folders,
i.e.  'arrays', 'strings', 'trees', etc. Each problem
is implemented in a separate file, consisting of the
solution itself, as well as a unit test. Running the
project runs all the unit tests.

The project was developed using the IntelliJ IDE,
running on Mac OS X El Capitan. If you port the
project to another platform, you may have to make
minor changes.

Enjoy!
