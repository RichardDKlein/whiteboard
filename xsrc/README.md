# whiteboard-java

Common whiteboard problems asked during coding interviews,
solved in Java.

The problems are grouped by category into folders,
e.g.  'arrays', 'strings', 'trees', etc. Each problem
is implemented in a separate file, consisting of the
solution itself, as well as a unit test. Running the
project runs all the unit tests.

The project was developed using the IntelliJ IDE,
running on Mac OS X. If you import the project into
another IDE, you may have to make minor changes.

Enjoy!
